# 🐛 Bug Fixes: Score Submission & Leaderboard Refresh

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Multiple Score Submissions ❌→✅
**Problem**: After finishing one game, players could click "Submit to Blockchain" button multiple times, creating duplicate entries.

**Impact**: 
- Spam transactions
- Duplicate leaderboard entries
- Wasted XLM fees
- Confusing user experience

### Issue 2: Leaderboard Not Refreshing ❌→✅
**Problem**: After submitting a score, the leaderboard didn't update automatically to show the new score.

**Impact**:
- User had to manually click refresh
- Confusing - looked like submission failed
- Poor user experience

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Score Submission Once Per Game

#### Added State Tracking:
```typescript
const [scoreSubmitted, setScoreSubmitted] = useState(false);
```

#### Updated Submit Handler:
```typescript
const handleSubmitScore = async () => {
  if (!walletAddress || score === 0 || scoreSubmitted) return; // ✅ Check if already submitted
  
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  try {
    await submitScore(walletAddress, username, score);
    setScoreSubmitted(true); // ✅ Mark as submitted
    alert('Score submitted successfully! Refreshing leaderboard...');
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      setLeaderboardKey(prev => prev + 1);
      console.log('🔄 Leaderboard refresh triggered');
    }, 2000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to submit score:', error);
    alert('Failed to submit score. Please try again.');
    setScoreSubmitted(false); // ✅ Reset on error so they can retry
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};
```

#### Reset on New Game:
```typescript
const startGame = () => {
  // ... game setup ...
  setScoreSubmitted(false); // ✅ Allow submission for new game
};
```

#### Updated Button UI:
```typescript
<button
  onClick={handleSubmitScore}
  disabled={isSubmitting || scoreSubmitted} // ✅ Disable if submitted
  className={
    scoreSubmitted
      ? 'bg-green-600 cursor-not-allowed opacity-75' // ✅ Green when done
      : 'bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600'
  }
>
  {scoreSubmitted ? '✅ Score Submitted!' : isSubmitting ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit to Blockchain'}
</button>
```

---

### Fix 2: Auto-Refresh Leaderboard

#### How It Works:
1. **Component Key**: Leaderboard has a `key` prop
   ```typescript
   <Leaderboard key={leaderboardKey} currentUsername={username} />
   ```

2. **Key Changes**: After submission, increment the key
   ```typescript
   setLeaderboardKey(prev => prev + 1);
   ```

3. **React Remounts**: When key changes, React unmounts and remounts the component

4. **Data Reloads**: On mount, `useEffect` calls `loadLeaderboard()`

#### Timing Consideration:
Added 2-second delay to allow blockchain to process:
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  setLeaderboardKey(prev => prev + 1);
}, 2000); // Wait for blockchain
```

#### Why the Delay?
- Blockchain transactions take time to finalize
- Soroban needs to process and store the data
- Too fast = old data still cached
- 2 seconds = safe buffer for testnet

## User Flow (Before vs After)

### Before ❌
```
1. Play game → Game over (score: 100)
2. Click "Submit to Blockchain" → Transaction sent
3. Click again → Transaction sent (duplicate!)
4. Click again → Transaction sent (triple!)
5. Look at leaderboard → Still shows old scores
6. Manually click refresh → New scores appear
```

### After ✅
```
1. Play game → Game over (score: 100)
2. Click "Submit to Blockchain" → Transaction sent
3. Button changes to "✅ Score Submitted!" (disabled)
4. Alert: "Score submitted successfully! Refreshing leaderboard..."
5. After 2 seconds → Leaderboard auto-refreshes
6. Your new score appears automatically!
7. Click "Play Again" → Submit button resets for next game
```

## Visual Feedback

### Button States:

**Ready to Submit**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Submit to Blockchain      │  (Purple/Blue gradient)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Submitting**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      Submitting...          │  (Disabled, dimmed)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Already Submitted**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   ✅ Score Submitted!       │  (Green, disabled)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
1. `pages/snake.tsx`
   - Added `scoreSubmitted` state
   - Updated `handleSubmitScore()` to prevent duplicates
   - Updated `startGame()` to reset flag
   - Changed button styling and text
   - Increased refresh delay to 2 seconds

### Logic Flow:
```
Game Over → Score = 100
  ↓
scoreSubmitted = false (default)
  ↓
User clicks "Submit" → scoreSubmitted = true
  ↓
Transaction sent → Alert shown
  ↓
Wait 2 seconds → Refresh leaderboard
  ↓
User clicks "Play Again" → scoreSubmitted = false
  ↓
Can submit new score
```

---

## Error Handling

### If Submission Fails:
```typescript
catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to submit score:', error);
  alert('Failed to submit score. Please try again.');
  setScoreSubmitted(false); // ✅ Reset so user can retry
}
```

### Why Reset on Error:
- User can try again without restarting game
- Network issues shouldn't block retries
- Failed transaction = no duplicate risk

## Performance Impact

### Additional State:
- `scoreSubmitted`: Boolean (negligible memory)
- `leaderboardKey`: Number (negligible memory)

### Additional Logic:
- One extra check: `|| scoreSubmitted` in condition
- One `setTimeout`: 2-second delay (minimal)
- Component remount: Standard React behavior

### Network Impact:
- **Before**: Unlimited duplicate transactions ❌
- **After**: One transaction per game ✅
- **Savings**: Prevents spam, reduces fees

---

## Benefits

### User Experience:
✅ Clear visual feedback (button state changes)
✅ No accidental duplicate submissions
✅ Automatic leaderboard updates
✅ Professional feel

### Developer Benefits:
✅ Clean state management
✅ Easy to understand logic
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Console logs for debugging

### Network Benefits:
✅ Reduced transaction spam
✅ Lower fees for users
✅ Less blockchain congestion

---

## Known Limitations

### 2-Second Delay:
- Sometimes blockchain is faster (< 2 seconds)
- Sometimes slower (> 2 seconds)
- Trade-off: Better to wait too long than too short
- User can always manually refresh if needed

### Testnet Latency:
- Testnet can be slow
- Mainnet is typically faster
- 2 seconds is conservative for testnet

---

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Smart Polling**: Check if transaction is confirmed before refreshing
2. **Progress Indicator**: Show countdown during 2-second wait
3. **Toast Notification**: Instead of alert(), use elegant toast
4. **Optimistic Update**: Show score immediately, confirm later
5. **Retry Button**: If submission fails, show retry button

## Server Information

**Dev Server**: http://localhost:3001
(Port 3000 was in use, automatically switched to 3001)

---

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test:
```
1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Enter username and connect wallet
3. Click Snake game
4. Play until game over
5. Click "Submit to Blockchain" → ✅ Works once
6. Try clicking again → ✅ Disabled

2. ✅ Button shows clear state (Ready → Submitting → Submitted)
3. ✅ Leaderboard auto-refreshes after 2 seconds
4. ✅ New game resets submission flag
5. ✅ Error handling allows retries
