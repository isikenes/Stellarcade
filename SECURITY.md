# 🔒 Security & Identity Verification

## Identity on Blockchain ✅

### TL;DR: **You are 100% SAFE!**

Your rewards are protected by cryptographic signatures. Nobody can steal your rewards, even if they use your username.

---

## How Identity Works

### 1. **Wallet = Your Identity**
- Your identity is your **wallet address** (starts with G...)
- This is secured by your **private key** (stored in Freighter)
- Username is just a display name, NOT your identity

### 2. **Transaction Signing**
Every blockchain action requires YOUR signature:
- ✅ Only YOU can sign with your private key
- ✅ Freighter prompts you to approve each transaction
- ✅ Nobody can impersonate your wallet

### 3. **Smart Contract Verification**
```rust
pub fn submit_score(env: Env, player: Address, username: String, score: u32) {
    // ⚡ THIS LINE VERIFIES YOUR IDENTITY!
    player.require_auth();
    
    // This checks:
    // 1. Was this transaction signed by 'player' address?
    // 2. Is the signature cryptographically valid?
    // 3. If NO → Transaction rejected
    // 4. If YES → Continue...
}
```

## Scenario: What if someone uses MY username?

### Scenario Details:
- Your wallet: `GABC...XYZ`
- Your username: `ProGamer`
- Attacker wallet: `GDEF...123`
- Attacker tries: `submitScore(GDEF...123, "ProGamer", 9999)`

### What Happens:
1. ✅ Transaction succeeds (they can use any username)
2. ✅ Score saved as: `{ player: "GDEF...123", username: "ProGamer", score: 9999 }`
3. ✅ Leaderboard shows TWO entries:
   - `ProGamer` (wallet: GABC...XYZ) **(You)** ← Your real entry
   - `ProGamer` (wallet: GDEF...123) ← Fake entry

### Can they claim YOUR reward?
❌ **ABSOLUTELY NOT!**

```rust
pub fn claim_reward(env: Env, player: Address) -> bool {
    player.require_auth(); // Must sign with private key
    
    let top_score = Self::get_top_score(env.clone());
    
    match top_score {
        Some(top) => {
            // ⚡ THIS COMPARISON USES WALLET ADDRESS, NOT USERNAME!
            if top.player == player {
                // Only if YOUR wallet is #1 AND YOU signed this
                return true;
            }
            false
        }
        None => false,
    }
}
```

### Why It's Safe:
1. **Address Comparison**: `if top.player == player`
   - Compares wallet addresses: `GABC...XYZ == GDEF...123`?
   - Result: FALSE → Claim rejected

2. **Signature Verification**: `player.require_auth()`
   - Checks: "Did `GDEF...123` sign this?"
   - Even if they try to pass YOUR address, the signature won't match
   - Result: Transaction rejected by blockchain

## Visual Security Flow

### Submitting Score:
```
User: "I want to submit score 100 as 'CoolPlayer'"
                ↓
Freighter: "Sign this transaction with your private key"
                ↓
User: *Approves in Freighter*
                ↓
Blockchain: "Verify signature... ✅ Valid!"
                ↓
Contract: "Save: { player: G...XYZ, username: 'CoolPlayer', score: 100 }"
```

### Claiming Reward (Legitimate):
```
Top Player (G...ABC): "I want to claim my reward"
                ↓
Freighter: "Sign with your private key"
                ↓
Contract: "Is G...ABC the #1 player? ✅ YES"
Contract: "Is signature valid? ✅ YES"
                ↓
Reward: ✅ CLAIMED!
```

### Claiming Reward (Attacker):
```
Attacker (G...XYZ): "I want to claim the reward"
                ↓
Freighter: "Sign with your private key"
                ↓
Contract: "Is G...XYZ the #1 player? ❌ NO (G...ABC is #1)"
                ↓
Reward: ❌ REJECTED!
```

### Claiming Reward (Attacker tries to fake address):
```
Attacker: "submitScore(G...ABC, 'FakeName', 9999)" [Trying to use victim's address]
                ↓
Blockchain: "Verify signature from G...ABC... ❌ INVALID"
                ↓
Transaction: ❌ REJECTED BEFORE REACHING CONTRACT!
```

## Technical Details

### Stellar/Soroban Security Features:

1. **Ed25519 Signatures**
   - Industry-standard cryptography
   - Used by Signal, Telegram, etc.
   - Impossible to forge without private key

2. **Address Derivation**
   - Public key → Wallet address (G...)
   - One-way: Can't reverse engineer private key

3. **Transaction Verification**
   - Every transaction includes:
     - Source account (your address)
     - Signature (proves you authorized it)
     - Sequence number (prevents replay attacks)

4. **Contract-Level Auth**
   - `require_auth()` enforced by Soroban runtime
   - Happens BEFORE contract code executes
   - No way to bypass

## What Usernames Are For

### ✅ Good Use: Display Name
- Makes leaderboard readable
- Shows who you are to other players
- Can be changed each game session

### ❌ Not Used For: Identity/Security
- NOT checked for uniqueness
- NOT used for authentication
- NOT used for reward distribution

---

## How to Verify YOUR Entry

### On Leaderboard:
Look for the purple highlight and "(You)" label:
```
🥇 ProGamer (You)     1000 pts
   GABC...XYZ
   
🥈 ProGamer           800 pts
   GDEF...123
```

### The frontend checks:
```typescript
isCurrentUser: entry.address === userAddress && entry.username === currentUser
```

This ensures:
1. ✅ Wallet address matches yours
2. ✅ Username matches your current session
3. ✅ Only YOUR entry shows "(You)"

---

## Additional Security Measures

### 1. **Freighter Wallet Protection**
- Password-protected
- Never shares private keys
- Shows transaction details before signing
- You approve each action

### 2. **Network Isolation**
- Testnet vs Mainnet separation
- Different addresses/keys for each
- Test money has no real value

### 3. **Contract Immutability**
- Once deployed, contract code can't change
- Security rules are permanent
- No admin can override auth checks

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Can someone steal my score?
**A:** No. Scores are cryptographically linked to your wallet address.

### Q: Can someone claim my reward?
**A:** No. Only the wallet address that submitted the #1 score can claim.

### Q: Can someone delete my score?
**A:** No. Blockchain data is immutable once written.

### Q: Should I use a unique username?
**A:** Optional. It helps YOU identify your entry, but isn't required for security.

### Q: What if I see duplicate usernames?
**A:** Normal! Check the wallet addresses (G...XXX) to distinguish players.

### Q: Can the contract owner change my score?
**A:** No. This contract has no admin functions. All changes must be signed by the player.

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep your Freighter password secure
- Review transactions before approving
- Use memorable usernames to track your scores
- Check wallet addresses if confused

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share your Freighter password
- Approve transactions you didn't initiate
- Trust username alone for identity
- Worry about username theft (it's harmless)

---

## Summary

### 🔒 Your Security Guarantees:

1. ✅ **Identity = Wallet Address** (not username)
2. ✅ **All actions require YOUR signature**
3. ✅ **Contract verifies wallet address** (not username)
4. ✅ **Nobody can claim your rewards**
5. ✅ **Blockchain is immutable and transparent**
6. ✅ **Username is just a display label**

### The Bottom Line:
**Your rewards are secured by the same cryptography that protects billions of dollars in crypto. Username duplication is a cosmetic issue, not a security issue.**

## Auto-Refresh Leaderboard ✅

### New Feature Added:
When you submit a score, the leaderboard now automatically refreshes!

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const handleSubmitScore = async () => {
  await submitScore(walletAddress, username, score);
  alert('Score submitted successfully!');
  
  // ✅ Auto-refresh leaderboard
  setLeaderboardKey(prev => prev + 1);
};
```

**How it works**:
- Changes the React `key` prop on Leaderboard component
- Forces component to remount
- Triggers fresh data fetch from blockchain
- Your new score appears immediately!

---

## Test It Yourself!

### Security Test:
1. Submit a score with username "TestUser"
2. Open in incognito/another browser
3. Connect different wallet
4. Try to submit score with same "TestUser" name
5. ✅ Both appear on leaderboard with different addresses
6. ✅ Try to claim reward → Only real #1 player can claim

### Auto-Refresh Test:
1. Play Snake and get a score
2. Click "Submit to Blockchain"
3. ✅ Watch leaderboard update automatically
4. ✅ Your entry appears without manual refresh!

**You are completely protected! Enjoy the game! 🎮🔒**
