# ðŸ’° Understanding XLM Transaction Fees

## âœ… Yes, XLM Fees Are Normal!

When you submit a score (or any transaction) on Stellar, you need to pay a small XLM fee. This is completely normal and expected!

## ðŸ’µ How Much Does It Cost?

- **Typical Fee**: ~0.00001 XLM (practically free!)
- **Soroban Contract Calls**: May be slightly higher (~0.0001-0.001 XLM)
- **Still very cheap**: Less than $0.01 USD per transaction

## ðŸ¤” Why Do I Need XLM?

1. **Network Fees**: Stellar charges fees to prevent spam
2. **Computational Cost**: Smart contracts use network resources
3. **Security**: Fees make attacks expensive

## ðŸ’³ Getting Testnet XLM

Since you're on **Testnet**, the XLM is FREE! Get more at:
